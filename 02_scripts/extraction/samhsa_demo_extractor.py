SAMHSA Outpatient Treatment Centers Demo Extractor

This script demonstrates the extraction and processing of SAMHSA outpatient
treatment facility data. It creates sample data structures and shows how
the real extraction would work with actual N-SUMHSS data.

This serves as a demonstration of the data processing pipeline while we
work on accessing the actual SAMHSA N-SUMHSS dataset.
