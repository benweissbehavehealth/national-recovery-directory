## Executive Summary

The National Recovery Support Services Directory project has successfully extracted and organized data for **{data['summary']['total_organizations']:,} recovery support organizations** across the United States.

## Organizations by Category

### NARR-Certified Recovery Residences
- **Total**: {data['summary']['by_category']['narr_certified_residences']:,} organizations
- **Description**: Sober living homes certified by National Alliance for Recovery Residences
- **Certification Levels**: Level I-IV (Peer-Run to Service Provider)

### Recovery Community Centers (RCCs)
- **Total**: {data['summary']['by_category']['recovery_community_centers']:,} centers
- **Description**: Peer-run centers offering recovery support services
- **Services**: Peer support, recovery coaching, meetings, social activities

### Recovery Community Organizations (RCOs)
- **Total**: {data['summary']['by_category']['recovery_community_organizations']:,} organizations
- **Description**: Advocacy and organizing groups (distinct from service delivery)
- **Focus**: Policy, mobilization, systemic change

### Licensed Treatment Centers
- **Total**: {data['summary']['by_category']['treatment_centers']['total']:,} facilities
  - **Outpatient**: {data['summary']['by_category']['treatment_centers']['outpatient']:,} facilities
  - **Residential**: {data['summary']['by_category']['treatment_centers']['residential']:,} facilities
  - **Inpatient**: {data['summary']['by_category']['treatment_centers']['inpatient']:,} facilities

## Geographic Coverage

## Data Quality
- **Extraction Phases Complete**: {data['summary']['data_quality']['extraction_phases_complete']}
- **Original Target**: 17,000+ organizations
- **Achievement**: {(data['summary']['total_organizations'] / 17000) * 100:.1f}% of target

## Project Phases Completed
1. ✅ NARR Affiliates (29 state organizations)
2. ✅ NARR Certified Organizations ({data['summary']['by_category']['narr_certified_residences']:,} residences)
3. ✅ Recovery Community Centers ({data['summary']['by_category']['recovery_community_centers']:,} centers)
4. ✅ Recovery Community Organizations ({data['summary']['by_category']['recovery_community_organizations']:,} organizations)
5. ✅ Outpatient Treatment Centers ({data['summary']['by_category']['treatment_centers']['outpatient']:,} facilities)
6. ✅ Residential Treatment Centers ({data['summary']['by_category']['treatment_centers']['residential']:,} facilities)
7. ✅ Inpatient Treatment Centers (infrastructure created, data collection pending)

## Key Achievements
- Established scalable extraction framework
- Created standardized data schemas across all organization types
- Implemented automated aggregation pipelines
- Documented technical barriers and solutions
- Built reusable extraction scripts for monthly updates

## Next Steps
1. Address remaining technical barriers (browser automation for dynamic sites)
2. Complete inpatient facility data collection with API access
3. Implement monthly update automation
4. Develop API endpoints for directory access
5. Prepare for BehaveHealth platform integration

## File Locations
- **Comprehensive Directory**: `04_processed_data/comprehensive_recovery_directory.json`
- **Category-Specific Masters**: `04_processed_data/master_directories/`
- **Raw Extraction Data**: `03_raw_data/`
- **Extraction Scripts**: `02_scripts/`
- **Reports**: `05_reports/`
