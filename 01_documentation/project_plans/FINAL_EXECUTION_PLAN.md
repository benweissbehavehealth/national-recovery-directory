# Final Execution Plan: Comprehensive NARR Directory Extraction

## Strategy Overview
1. **Maximum Parallelization**: Run 15 agents simultaneously 
2. **Code-First Approach**: Prioritize code-based extraction over manual analysis
3. **Hybrid Methodology**: Combine web scraping, API calls, and structured data extraction
4. **Cost Optimization**: Use agents to write and execute code rather than manual research

## Execution Tiers

### Tier 1: Code-Based Web Scraping (5 Agents)
**Target**: Affiliates with structured HTML/JSON data
- **Massachusetts MASH** - Dynamic directory scraping
- **Texas TROHN** - Database extraction scripts  
- **Georgia GARR** - Multi-level structured extraction
- **Michigan MARR** - Operator database parsing
- **Pennsylvania PARR** - Regional directory aggregation

**Agent Instructions**: "Write Python/JavaScript code to systematically extract ALL certified organizations. Focus on automated scraping, API calls, and structured data parsing."

### Tier 2: Interactive System Automation (5 Agents)  
**Target**: Search-based and dynamic systems
- **Arizona AzRHA** - GetHelp SDK automation
- **Washington WAQRR** - Interactive directory automation
- **Colorado CARR** - Search interface automation
- **Oklahoma OKARR** - Portal automation scripts
- **Virginia VARR** - DBHDS system integration

**Agent Instructions**: "Write automation scripts to interact with search interfaces, form submissions, and JavaScript-heavy sites. Extract complete provider listings programmatically."

### Tier 3: Direct Contact + Fallback Extraction (5 Agents)
**Target**: Member-only or restricted access systems
- **California CCAPP** - Member portal analysis + contact script
- **Florida FARR** - Alternative data source mining + contact
- **Ohio ORH** - System recovery + alternative sources
- **New York NYSARR** - Alternative data mining
- **Connecticut CTARR** - Directory reconstruction

**Agent Instructions**: "Write scripts to find alternative data sources, analyze cached content, and prepare automated contact workflows. Develop fallback extraction methods."

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Code Frameworks Per Agent Type

#### Web Scraping Agents (Tier 1)
```python
# Standard toolkit for each agent
import requests
import beautifulsoup4
import selenium
import pandas as pd
import json
import time
from urllib.parse import urljoin, urlparse

# Template structure for each extraction
def extract_affiliate_directory(base_url, affiliate_name):
    """
    Comprehensive extraction template
    Returns: List of all certified organizations
    """
    pass

# Each agent writes specific implementation
```

#### Automation Agents (Tier 2)  
```python
# Interactive system toolkit
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
import playwright
import requests_html

# Template for interactive extraction
def automate_search_system(search_url, search_params):
    """
    Automated search and extraction
    Returns: Complete provider database
    """
    pass
```

#### Research + Contact Agents (Tier 3)
```python
# Multi-source research toolkit  
import wayback_machine_api
import google_search_api
import social_media_scrapers
import email_automation

# Template for comprehensive research
def research_alternative_sources(affiliate_info):
    """
    Find all possible data sources
    Returns: Aggregated provider information
    """
    pass
```

## Parallel Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Launch All 15 Agents Simultaneously
```
Agent 1  -> Massachusetts MASH (Code: Dynamic directory scraping)
Agent 2  -> Texas TROHN (Code: Complete database extraction)  
Agent 3  -> Georgia GARR (Code: Multi-level parsing)
Agent 4  -> Michigan MARR (Code: Operator database mining)
Agent 5  -> Pennsylvania PARR (Code: Regional aggregation)
Agent 6  -> Arizona AzRHA (Code: GetHelp SDK automation)
Agent 7  -> Washington WAQRR (Code: Interactive directory automation)
Agent 8  -> Colorado CARR (Code: Search automation)
Agent 9  -> Oklahoma OKARR (Code: Portal automation)
Agent 10 -> Virginia VARR (Code: DBHDS integration)
Agent 11 -> California CCAPP (Code: Multi-source research)
Agent 12 -> Florida FARR (Code: Alternative data mining)
Agent 13 -> Ohio ORH (Code: System recovery)
Agent 14 -> New York NYSARR (Code: Directory reconstruction)
Agent 15 -> Connecticut CTARR (Code: Cached content analysis)
```

### Success Metrics Per Agent
- **Tier 1**: Extract 100+ organizations each (500+ total)
- **Tier 2**: Extract 50+ organizations each (250+ total)  
- **Tier 3**: Extract 20+ organizations each (100+ total)
- **Combined Target**: 850+ total organizations

## Output Standardization

### Each Agent Must Produce:
1. **Python script** used for extraction
2. **Raw data file** (JSON/CSV) with all findings
3. **Standardized output** following master directory schema
4. **Execution report** with success metrics and limitations
5. **Replication instructions** for monthly updates

### File Naming Convention:
```
/comprehensive_extraction/
├── tier1_mass_mash_code.py
├── tier1_mass_mash_data.json
├── tier1_mass_mash_report.md
├── tier1_texas_trohn_code.py
├── tier1_texas_trohn_data.json
├── tier1_texas_trohn_report.md
[...etc for all 15 agents...]
├── master_comprehensive_directory.json
└── execution_summary.md
```

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Validation
Each agent includes validation code:
```python
def validate_extraction(organizations):
    """
    Validate extracted data quality
    - Check required fields completion
    - Verify contact information format
    - Detect duplicates
    - Score data completeness
    """
    return quality_score, validation_report
```

### Cross-Referencing
- Compare overlapping geographic areas
- Identify organizations listed by multiple affiliates
- Validate contact information consistency
- Flag potential data quality issues

## Cost Optimization Benefits

### Code-First Approach Advantages:
1. **Reusability**: Scripts can be run monthly with minor updates
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new affiliates or modify extraction logic
3. **Consistency**: Standardized extraction reduces manual errors
4. **Efficiency**: Agents writing code is more cost-effective than manual research
5. **Documentation**: Code serves as methodology documentation

### Estimated Efficiency Gains:
- **Speed**: 15x faster than sequential analysis
- **Coverage**: 10-15x more organizations extracted
- **Cost**: 60-70% reduction per organization through automation
- **Accuracy**: Reduced manual errors through systematic extraction

## Execution Timeline

### Immediate Launch (Next 4 Hours):
- **Hour 1**: Launch all 15 agents with specific coding instructions
- **Hour 2**: Monitor initial results and provide guidance as needed
- **Hour 3**: Agents complete code development and initial runs
- **Hour 4**: Data aggregation and initial validation

### Follow-up (Next 24 Hours):
- Refine scripts based on initial results
- Execute comprehensive runs for all 15 affiliates
- Aggregate and validate complete dataset
- Generate final comprehensive directory

## Success Definition
- **Minimum Target**: 500+ certified organizations (9x current)
- **Optimal Target**: 1,000+ certified organizations (18x current)
- **Geographic Coverage**: All 29 NARR affiliate states
- **Data Quality**: 80%+ complete contact information
- **Automation**: 90%+ of extraction process automated for monthly updates

This plan maximizes efficiency through parallel processing, emphasizes reusable code solutions, and provides a foundation for ongoing monthly updates with minimal manual intervention.
